## Predicting Company Bankruptcy Using Liability Financial Metrics

Business failures, or "bankruptcies" as they may be more commonly referred to as, are a very real and unfortunate part of society. They can occur through the natural course of progression (such as smartphone cameras replacing the non-professional dedicated camera market), or be exacerbated through exogenous shocks (such as the dot-com bubble of 2001, or the 2007 financial crisis). In this analysis, we will try to determine if we can predict the looming bankruptcy of a company based on a variety of their fundamental financial metrics. Specifically, we will be looking at various debt and/or liability ratios in conducting our analysis.

The dataset we will be using is the Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction dataset, which comes from the Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ). Founded in April 1990, the TEJ has specialized in providing all required and value-added information for fundamental analysis of the securities financial market[1]. Between the years 1999 and 2009, the TEJ recorded 220 instances of bankruptcy within the 6,819 instances of companies and the financial metrics they analyzed [2]. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business rules of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.
